# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio page. This is the product of countless hours of banging my head against my desk. In this portfolio you will get a general sense of where I am at in my life and hopefully a taste of my personality. 

I can't wait to build this page out with completed projects that are the result of many more hours of head-to-desk contact. 

## Expectations

The navigation bar is functioning and will take you to the desired sections for easy browsing. There is also a link to my LinkedIn page for more background on my professional history. 

The page is responsive and will fit to accomodate any size screen using media queries. 

I opted to lean more on a 'grid' layout as opposed to FlexBox. It was much easier for me to wrap my head around the grid. 

## Screenshots

The following show the page in two different formats. One for standard browsing and the other for browsing on smaller screens.
